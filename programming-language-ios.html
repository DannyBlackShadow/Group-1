                <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone, iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007) and the iPad (January 2010). As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contains more than 2.2 million iOS applications, 1 million of which are native for iPads. These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode). Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS, enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">Major versions of iOS are released annually. The current version, iOS 10, was released on September 13, 2016. It is available for the iPhone 5 and later iPhone models, the fourth-generation iPad, the iPad Air and iPad Air 2, the iPad Pro, the iPad Mini 2 and later iPad Mini models, and the sixth-generation iPod Touch. Its successor, iOS 11, was announced on June 5, 2017, with a consumer release set for late 2017.</p>

<p class="lead" style="margin-top: 30px"><b>History</b></p>
<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">In 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either "shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within iTunes.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference & Expo on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year. At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: "iPhone runs OS X" and runs "desktop applications", but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed "iPhone OS".Initially, third-party native applications were not supported. Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web browser that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone". In October 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February". On March 6, 2008, Apple held a press event, announcing the iPhone SDK.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">The iOS App Store was opened on July 10, 2008 with an initial 500 applications available. This quickly grew to 3,000 in September 2008, 15,000 in January 2009, 50,000 in June 2009, 100,000 in November 2009, 250,000 in August 2010, 650,000 in July 2012, 1 million in October 2013, 2 million in June 2016, and 2.2 million in January 2017. As of March 2016, 1 million apps are natively compatible with the iPad tablet computer. These apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times. App intelligence firm Sensor Tower has estimated that the App Store will reach 5 million apps by the year 2020.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">In September 2007, Apple announced the iPod Touch, a redesigned iPod based on the iPhone form factor. In January 2010, Apple announced the iPad, featuring a larger screen than the iPhone and iPod Touch, and designed for web browsing, media consumption, and reading.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">In June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as "iOS". The trademark "IOS" had been used by Cisco for over a decade for its operating system, IOS, used on its routers. To avoid any potential lawsuit, Apple licensed the "IOS" trademark from Cisco.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">In October 2016, Apple opened its first iOS Developer Academy in Naples inside University of Naples Federico II's new campus.</p>

<p class="lead" style="margin-top: 30px"><b>Software updates</b></p>
<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">See also: iPhone OS 1, iPhone OS 2, iPhone OS 3, iOS 4, iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10, and iOS 11
Circle frame.svg</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">Apple provides major updates to the iOS operating system annually via iTunes and also, for iOS 5 and later, over-the-air. The latest version is iOS 10, released on September 13, 2016. It is available for iPhone 5 and later, fourth-generation iPad, first- and second-generation iPad Air, iPad Pro, iPad Mini 2 and later, and sixth-generation iPod Touch.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">On June 5, 2017, Apple announced iOS 10's successor, iOS 11, set for consumer release in late 2017.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">Originally, iPod Touch users had to pay for system software updates. This was due to accounting rules making the device not a "subscription device" like iPhone or Apple TV, and significant enhancements to the device required payments. The requirement to pay to upgrade caused iPod Touch owners to stay away from updates. However, in September 2009, a change in accounting rules won tentative approval, significantly affecting both Apple's earnings and stock price, and allowing iPod Touch updates to be delivered for free.</p>

<p class="lead" style="margin-top: 30px"><b>Hardware</b></p>
<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">The main hardware platform for iOS is the ARM architecture. iOS releases up till iOS 6 can only be run on iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors (ARMv6 and ARMv7-A architectures). In 2013, iOS 7 was released with full 64-bit support (which includes native 64-bit kernel, libraries, drivers as well as all built-in applications), after Apple announced that they were switching to 64-bit ARMv8-A processors with the introduction of the Apple A7 chip. 64-bit support was also enforced for all apps in the App Store; All new apps submitted to the App Store with a deadline of February 2015, and all app updates submitted to the App Store with a deadline of June 1, 2015.Apple is set to release iOS 11 in late 2017, which drops support for all iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors as well as 32-bit applications, making iOS 64-bit only.</p>

<p class="lead" style="margin-top: 30px"><b>Development</b></p>
<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">The iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) allows for the development of mobile apps on iOS.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing them to make web applications for the Safari web browser. However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider, with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008. The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">The SDK is a free download for users of Mac personal computers. It is not available for Microsoft Windows PCs. The SDK contains sets giving developers access to various functions and services of iOS devices, such as hardware and software attributes. It also contains an iPhone simulator to mimic the look and feel of the device on the computer while developing. New versions of the SDK accompany new versions of iOS. In order to test applications, get technical support, and distribute apps through App Store, developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">Combined with Xcode, the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially-supported programming languages, including Swift and Objective-C. Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages.</p>
